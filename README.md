# Advanced Python
Advanced level Python course for Business students at Esade. Do you want to understand a bit better how programming is changing companies? Do you want to better understand the backbone behind tech companies? Do you want to know why this may be essential for every company to survive? In the world that we are living, some companies are starting to make some, if not most, of their business decisions based on analyzing their data. They are becoming what is called Data-Driven. However, what is the background of all of it? It is computer programming, and, in many cases, the programming language employed is Python. Therefore, a better understanding of Python programming and data processing automation is becoming an essential skill in the future for any professional. However, doing it properly while allowing other people to use your solution and making it optimized enough to reduce the cost of using it is also becoming increasingly important. Therefore, skilled programmers and people capable of understanding their work and the business are in need in all areas.

# Course Goals and Objectives

The skills the student will acquire while taking this course can be summarized as follows:

- Dig deeper into the framework and relevance of programming in companies in today's world
- Grasp the benefits and scope of programming in a Data-Driven world and Python in particular.
- Acquire a thorough comprehension of Python structures, tools, libraries, best practices, and data
manipulation using Python.
- Learn how to optimize, parallelize and test code, write modular Python scripts and employ a distributed
version control system.
- Ability to apply these skills to real-life datasets to develop an end-to-end project.

# Syllabus

- Relevance of programming in the current world. Impact of programming in companies and shift towards data-driven decisions.
- Mastering Python fundamentals: Data types, Data Structure, Functions, Python Classes
- Acquire python advanced concepts: Scripting, Debugging, Command line interfaces (Click), Testing, Git, Multiprocessing, threading, and more.
- Understanding how all these concepts apply to a data analysis process with different datasets examples. (Complete ETL process)
- Possibility to go beyond. Performance libraries (Tensorflow, Keras). Intro to deep learning with Python.

This is a hands-on course. Students are expected to participate actively during class and practice exercises

# Course Grading

This course is based on a participative methodology.
- Active participation and class attendance represent 60% of the course grade. 5 % Attendance - 55 % coding the exercises and uploading the document after every session to the Moodle.
- The final project will account for 40% of the course grade. The goal is to create a GitHub repository with all the information (code + text) of your analyses on a given dataset or an open-source one applying the different topics learned in class and explaining the steps taken. You will need to upload a link to the Moodle max two weeks after the last lecture.

# Installation
## Clone repository
If you want to make use of all the materials, cloning the code to your local or downloading it would be the best. In order to do so:

    git clone git@github.com:pepebonet/Advanced_Python_BBA.git

## Install dependencies
We highly recommend to use a virtual environment to work with the code, as additional packages may need to be downloaded as you keep coding. To do so:

`Create environment:`

    conda create --name python_adv python=3.8
    conda activate python_adv
